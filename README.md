#### Hi! I'm George! 👋

I am a Software Engineer 👨‍💻 at Grafana Labs ⛺️ working on Loki, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.

Before I joined the Loki team, I worked on Grafana Alerting in the Alerting team and contributed to an open-source project called Prometheus Alertmanager. Most recently I added support for Unicode (UTF-8) as part of a larger effort to adopt OpenTelemetry (OTel) in Prometheus. I have also contributed a number of other features, bug fixes, triaged issues and reviewed pull requests from the community. I have built up a large amount of domain knowledge in Alertmanager and have written a number of blog posts on it which you can find on my [personal website](https://www.grobinson.net). You can find all my contributions [here](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agrobinson-grafana+).
